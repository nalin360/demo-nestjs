# Which framework is more suitable for building APIs?

Both NestJS and Express are great choices for building APIs. NestJS provides a more structured and opinionated approach, which can make it easier to build complex APIs with proper separation of concerns. Express, on the other hand, is more

elightweight and flexible, which makes it a popular choice for simple or small-scale APIs.

# Controllers

Controllers are responsible for handling incoming **requests** and returning **responses** to the client.


![](https://docs.nestjs.com/assets/Controllers_1.png)

A controller's purpose is to receive specific requests for the application. 

The **routing** mechanism controls which controller receives which requests. Frequently, each controller has more than one route, and different routes can perform different actions.

Frequently, each controller has more than one route, and different routes can perform different actions.

```javascript
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  @Get()
  findAll(): string {
    return 'This action returns all cats';
  }
}
```



`@Controller()` decorator, which is **required** to define a basic controller. We'll specify an optional route path prefix of `cats`. 

***Using a path prefix in a `@Controller()` decorator allows us to easily group a set of related routes, and minimize repetitive code.***

For example, we may choose to group a set of routes that manage interactions with a cat entity under the route `/cats`. 

---

The `@Get()` HTTP request method decorator before the `findAll()` method tells Nest to create a handler for a specific endpoint for HTTP requests.

## What is the route path? 

The route path for a handler is determined by concatenating the (optional) prefix declared for the controller, and any path specified in the method's decorator.

***As mentioned, the path includes both the optional controller path prefix and any path string declared in the request method decorator. ***

***For example, a path prefix of `cats` combined with the decorator `@Get('breed')` would produce a route mapping for requests like `GET /cats/breed`.***


# Providers

Providers are a fundamental concept in Nest. Many of the basic Nest classes may be treated as a provider â€“ services, repositories, factories, helpers, and so on. The main idea of a provider is that it can be **injected** as a dependency; this means objects can create various relationships with each other, and the function of "wiring up" instances of objects can largely be delegated to the Nest runtime system
